            Use strong and unique passwords for all your accounts, and avoid reusing them across multiple accounts.
            Enable two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security. Keep your software and
            operating systems up to date with the latest security patches. Use antivirus and anti-malware software to
            protect against viruses and other online threats. Be cautious when sharing personal information online and
            avoid sharing sensitive information unless it is necessary.
